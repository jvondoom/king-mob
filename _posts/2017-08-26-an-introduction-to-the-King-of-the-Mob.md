description: A brief introduction to the King Mob's Journal

It’s been years since I saw King Mob for the first time; he wasn’t using his title back then, he wasn’t even as interesting or experienced as he looks right now. He was just a normal person, but the kind of man that hides a huge knowledge behind a smile and noble heart under a impertinent attitude. He still looks like that at the first glance, but you can feel the scars that time has left on his soul and you can see how his personality has adapted to a world that isn’t ready for him yet. 

Now that I look back, I understand the controversy around him. It’s easy to get lost in the many aspects of his personality or get lost in the unique point of view he can eagerly defends generated by the multilayered thoughts his mind can produce. Take this as a manual to help unravel the mystery of his character. 

I know this is going to be hard, but has he usually says: “There’s always a story to tell and a lesson to learn”. I don’t pretend to match his storytelling, it’s impossible to copy the way His Majesty transforms words into plays and how he acts his owns stories while telling them; but I’ll write down his tales the way he told them to me.
