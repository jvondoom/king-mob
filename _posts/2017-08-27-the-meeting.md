description: When King Mob met her
---

It was an odd night.

I didn't sense a lot of people out at night, even the taxi driver that took me home later agreed with me that the streets had a slow and quiet feeling. After midnight, suddenly, everyone appears to have decided to go out at the same time; it may have been because of the earlier rain or anything else...

I was having a beer at this crowded pub, where people had to struggle between the thirsty horde to order anything. I was wondering the reason what may have kept all the mob hiding from acquiring liquor on a Saturday night when I distinguished their king. He always enters a place walking as if he owns it; looking confident to all the faces not expecting to be noticed, dismissing greetings or slightly waving his brows at some.

As usual a gap was opened between the crowd so that he could took his place at the bar, where his beer was waiting for him freshly open without been ordered. I knew the protocol: you never seek for his attention, you have to wait until his eyes meet your gaze after scanning you. Without saying a word, he left a half bottle, looked at me and walked outside to smoke, his way of saying that he wants to speak. I speed my drink and followed him. 

King Mob carefully stopped me at the pub’s door and signaled the floor with his finger, blood drops decorated the tiles. I lifted my head and saw a drunken man fighting his way back to the place, but the security was asking him to leave the place in a not-so polite way (he received a hit from a glass delivered by a girl after this same man tried to touch her under her blouse). 

Once we were outside he watched the sky, his signal that something uncommon had occurred to him.

“What happened this time, Your Majesty?”. I asked. 

King Mob smirked after listening to the formality of my question. “You know you are the only one who uses my title?”.

“I'm the only one who knows you liked been called that way”. We both smiled at each other.

“I am not sure of what exactly just happened.”. He answered. I knew one of his stories was about to start.

King Mob loves to walk in his city, specially at night. 

He also do this alone. He is the embodiment of ‘Nor all those who wander are lost’. 

There are so many things that appear while walking streets at night; besides beggars, drunks and girls (or men dressed as girls) waiting for payed sex. You can see romance taking place in the shadows, short dresses surrounded by boys outside a disco, one of two suspicious faces looking for an easy prey to empty their pockets.

But this night His Majesty saw a gathering in a sidewalk, a lot of unknown faces standing outside a familiar building; all new except for one. He saw her at the distance and remember all the times he had seen her before, always at gigs. Always at night. King Mob particularly played in his mind the day he singed to her while his eyes were fixed on hers; she standing at the other side of the room watching him, pretending not to. They didn’t crossed words at that time, nor any other time; but they always were glancing at each other from the distance.
He knew that night was going to be different when her eyes drew a smile before her mouth after recognizing him getting closer to the small group. 

“Hey how are you?” She said, extending her arms to greet him. King Mob only had a fraction of a second to realize the change in her approach, he was no longer a stranger. Even so, his body barely returned the friendly warmness of her salute. 

“I am alright” He attempted to answer, hiding his excitement and surprise. “How cool it is that you now know my name”. He added after, still in her arms. 

She let escape a little surprise while releasing him. “How come not? I’ve keep hearing about you.” He smiled first knowing the reason. “Sonya keeps telling me: ‘You here… You there… He forced me to go out with him.’”.

“Forced? She said I forced her?” He appeared to get mad at this. “As if it was a hard task to make her drink!”. He smiled at seeing her laughing. “Where is she? I do not see her around.”.

“She’s at work, would get out soon. She’ll be here on time. She always do.” He nodded. “Come let me introduce you”. 

King Mob wouldn’t remember the names, he doesn’t wanted to. He only observed that her boyfriend was there. After the small assessment he performed through some probing questions to the four of five guys there, His Majesty was grateful that she was there. He could talk about almost every topic, as long as anyone could keep a conversation with him; only she could. 

“The gig is about to start”. Someone said. 

She looked at him. “Let’s go inside.” 

The music was already playing. They didn’t enter together, she did it first with some others; King Mob greeted some guys at the entrance before stepping in. He instantly knew where she was; he could recognize her even in the dimmed light of the place, he distinguished her silhouette from the rest of the attendants. Without a word he standed next to her and felt her eyes scanning him in the darkness, the same previous ritual being performed: both in silence, trying to conceal a peek at the other, failing to hide it. But this time it was at a close range, not across a room like the past times. 

Suddenly, after a few songs were played, she turned to him. “I’m going outside for a smoke, do you want to come with me?”. King Mob registered the tone of the question. He quickly scanned the place looking for the group that was with her, all of them were paying attention to the band performing. He also marked that her boyfriend was just a couple of steps away, but she only asked him. 

“Sure.”

There was a black piece of cloth at the entrance of the stage serving as a curtain, which he gentlemanly opened for her. Both rested at a window of the building, he couldn’t avoided watching her lips as she lighted her cigarette. When her eyes found his starring at her, His Majesty shifted his look to the street in front of them. 

“I like how the Theater looks with new new lights. It feels like being in another city.” She said. King Mob smiled just like when someone says something beautiful about a loved one, because he can’t mask his love for his city. He started talking about the buildings, the old ones being restored or painted in different ways, about how many of them has changed… They both chat revealing their personalities and minds, both enjoying the moment to start knowing the other. With the subtlety with which he disguises his feelings, King Mob revealed to her that he was going through some hard phases right now; which she replied “I’m glad that my music helps you with it.”. A brief silence let them acknowledge that a bond was created. 

“That is was music does.” He said breaking the pause that wasn’t uncomfortable. They continued talking.

When they realized another voices joined their conversation, King Mob noticed that the band stopped playing and all the people were outside smoking and discussing the performance. They both remained sitting together. 

The crowd got larger, something made her stand up and move closer to the door of the building. When the next band started to play. Her eyes signaled him to follow her inside. They repeated the same for the rest of the night: talks, glances, smiles.

“So did you asked for her number?” I asked.

“The time wasn’t right for it.” He replied in his King of the Mob voice, this mystical tone that makes you wonder if he could really gaze into the future or if truly an ethereal sign could mark him when is correct to act. He always answered like that when he couldn’t do something. I only stared at him waiting for him to elaborate. 

I knew he wouldn’t. He never gives explanations to anyone. 

“Maybe next time then”. I finally said before going inside the bar for the next round.
