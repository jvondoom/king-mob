description: Reasons why I consider myself a punk and why it isn't a negative thing
---

There are two kinds of persons in the World: the ones that live happily accepting when their environment sets up for them, and the ones that attempt to change whatever establish feels wrong.

The Merrian-Webster Dictionary defines <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revolution">revolution</a> <em>change of paradigm</em>, a fundamental change in the way of thinking. By this, apparently, it means that I’ve been a revolutionary most of my life.

When I was in high school, I started to perceive that there was something wrong with what society offer; the life that my parents wanted for me and what television showed felt like a fog that obscured my senses in a way I can’t describe properly. University started to disperse this numbness with every book and every conversation between courses I had; the more I learned, more I confirmed what my intuition was trying to tell me. But still in a subconscious way.

I remember my fists classes of Computer Science, where all my teaches agreed that the most important thing in a professional of this area was to develop logic. I felt eager to start using my mind in a correct way and, between lines, I could read that in all the programming books I took home. Today is still a common saying between developers that ‘no matter the language, what’s important is to apply logic’. But I couldn’t stop applying Logic in all aspects of my life; once you start analyzing problems, computer related or not, patterns and behaviors start to appear like elements in a chemistry formulae.

Naturally, my first inferences about society started to get more visible with every news appearing on television or newspaper. I started feeling more attracted to the Left Ideology and eventually idealized the events on France in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France">May of 1968</a> and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture">England in the 1970’s</a>. Young people believed they had the power to change things within their grasp and fought against the older traditions and, also, didn’t fear to express themselves in whatever form they felt proper. It is at this point in history where music starts to also express the discontent against the established. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> openly asked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_in_the_U.K.">Anarchy in the U.K.</a> and many responded to it; the radical group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Mob">King Mob</a> wrote on a <a href="http://www.revoltagainstplenty.com/index.php/archive-local/128-a-hidden-history-of-king-mob-posterscartoons.htmli">wall</a>:

<em>Same thing day after day - tube - work - dinner - work - tube - armchair - TV - sleep - tube - work - how much more can you take? - one in ten go mad, one in five cracks up</em>

This is a message I feel that still applies to our current society. But there is something I’d change, I think we should be asking a different question: <em>How much can we change?</em> Very often, more than I’d like to accept, I’m mocked for bringing my open disconformity against what I know isn’t right; people uses the word rebel as an insult, when thinking different is treated like a disease just because is different from what is expected. 

Here is where I need to make a point: it’s not the same to be against everything, than to stand for something. I know there are persons than need to confront anything that is said to them, which make them very difficult to talk to because of this pathological necessity of take the opposite position in every argument. I try hard not to be like this.

However there are several ideas that I have to defend in every case, in the most intellectual and reasonable way possible. Whenever you exchange opinions each view grows and evolves since it’s been watered by the experiences of the Other, either to strengthen or to weaken depending on how well sustained they are in the Mind. 

It is in these defenses that several people had made the first steps in creating a change: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> had a vision of a completely free and open Operative System that every one could use on their computer, and because of that he created the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> and, later, the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a> created a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">platform</a> where people, in a anonymous way, could distribute confidential material for a public discussion. It’s because of these two and many others that change started, even when being either insulted or judged or repressed or prosecuted. 

Why I am a punk then? Because I believe that change starts with small actions like saying, after a careful reasoning, when something should work in a different way; like analyzing information, not believing everything the news say and search for other sources; like stopping consuming mass media, the brain is the best computer created; don’t expect it to work properly if you install a lot of malware on it.
