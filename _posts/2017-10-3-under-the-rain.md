description: When King Mob met her 
--- 

It was raining heavily that night. The kind of rain that is passive enough to wash all the willing of step out of bed; but strong enough for everyone to get soaked after walking a few blocks. The thunders were roaring across the streets, while the mob bumped into each other because they were too focused on their umbrellas to avoid it. A typical thing to see these time of the year.

Anyone who has ever met King Mob knows where to find him. There are list of places he frequently visits; depending on the day, the hour, the weather or his mood. If you really want to see him or you need anything from him, don’t wait for him to answer a call or reply to a text message; the only way is to go out and find him.

Of course she didn’t know about this fact or anything about him at all, she just arrived from her home in Europe. It was her first night out in his City and wasn't expecting the experience of meeting with King Mob. She was used to travel by herself, her job made her interact with different cultures and being astonished by all the features that exist in this world. But nothing has ever prepared her for the kind of weather she found that night, the rain wasn’t like anything she had in mind when she saw the pictures on the magazine provided on the plane.

This time she was traveling for pleasure, to get a break after a hard time. She couldn’t remember the last time she got time to think without the pressure of a deadline or somebody yelling at her. She haven’t got used yet to feeling her shoulders so wide and relaxed, but staying in a different place is really a great help.

Weather was shit tonight. And nobody was in the mood for anything.

While I walked on the less crowded sidewalks, I saw the City bums trying to escape from the rain while asking for any change; even them were infected by the weather. I was wondering why I always needed to go out after the sun sets, it was like a rope pulling me towards the City; I always have this eagerness in my room that only leaves me when I sit on the bus on my way downtown. I was confident I wasn’t the only one feeling that way. I was wrong.

I hate when rain cancel my plans. Yesterday was my step-father’s birthday party, but I was stuck under a roof barely keeping myself dry; I have been pinned in this sidewalk for ten minutes already, weather wasn’t changing a bit. Gladly, my shelter was big enough to give me some steps to calm myself while moving. I was smoking only to keep track of time, I knew that I couldn’t be arriving on time. After an hour passed, I decided to go home. 

Tonight had to be different. The heavy rain had stopped early (before the sun set down); the night sky wasn’t clear, but the weather was calm and chilled enough to let me seek a place to go. I was lucky to run into a few friends, the streets were emptier that usual; the entrance were less crowder that usual on most bars, which is great if you’re looking for a empty table. After a couple of drinks, we all agreed that we should move to a different place; we called a taxi and after closing the car door a drizzle started. 

It was going to rain again.

The lighting was illuminating the dark sky, the thunders were muting the City sounds with their roar. Watching all that amount of water falling from the sky made Megan ask herself why she didn’t stayed at the hotel room; but quickly dismissed that thought by watching the street movement from the pizza place she chose to eat. 

Her window was next to the sidewalk: people was hiding under their umbrellas while some unlucky ones were running across the street looking for a temporary shelter. She noticed the group of women sitting a few tables away from her were chatting about ex-boyfriends and trying to give relationship advices to each other, clearly it wasn’t going to be a short conversation. That made her wonder why if the place was so empty the service was so slow.

Megan’s thoughts weren’t expressing how she felt that night. Her job made her criticize the ideas of the others, it was something hard to flip off when listening people talking; the weather also upset her a bit since it wasn’t was she had in mind. Putting these things aside, the excitement of finally having some time for herself made her feel free and relaxed. It was somehow scary to go out on a strange city at night, but seeing her meal arriving made her confident that everything was going to be alright. 

That night deserved a drink; she decided to follow the recommendations she got on the hotel even with the rain as bad as it was right now, she noticed that it wasn’t coming down several minutes after she ended her meal. There was something that made her walk on the streets on this unknown City, like a call in the night sky; she could feel the stars above the clouds’ veil pointing out the direction directly to her feet.

The rain finally gave up some room for a late night life, as it slowed its pace and eagerness. Gently the night creatures crawled outside their shelters, adding some movement to the now empty streets in the City and requesting drinks from the available spots around the pubs. 

King Mob felt the crowd growing when he approached the bar on his favorite place after emptying his glass, checked the hour and thought: <i>It’s getting late really fast</i>; he only had to glanced the bartender over the thirsty mob and nod to get another drink. After a long sip, he walked towards the terrace where his current companions kept the discussion alive. He liked being near the entrance, so that he could easily smoke without having to navigate the crowd; also the open space and its fresh air contrasting with the oven of the crowd inside.

Megan was skeptical regarding how early the places close on the City; a couple of hours after midnight wasn’t a decent moment for sleeping. Only one place was named by everyone, it was easy to find even for a newcomer; she only had to follow the exodus. The blue lights of the place and the loud noise revealed her destination, that and the horde of smokers outside the bar, surrounding the terrace. Her face drew a smile when she listened to the music, it was the same genre she was playing on the plane; <i>I’m starting to love this place</i> she thought after crossing the entrance, in search for something to drink.

The Moon appeared for the first time that night, its light dimmed by the clouds; King Mob noticed the change in the sky and turned his face to Her. One of his favorite songs started at that moment. When he lowered his gaze, something made him remember a recurring dream he have had in the last days: <i>a multitude of shadows walking around a room, suddenly a face is highlighted and he finds that that person is staring at him, this blonde girl has her eyes fixed at his; she smiles as she walks across the room to disappear again between the shadows.</i> 

After the flashback faded from his mind, King Mob realized that he had just lived that moment; but this time he wasn’t lying on his bed, instead the green eyes from his dream were staring back with a similar surprise look. <i>Sweetness and Light by Lush</i> started playing inside; Megan had a feeling different from a déjà vu, something closer like a memory being relived again. 

When Time felt not being paralyzed anymore, both smiled at each other. King Mob and Megan entered the pub together; after all, they needed another drink and the hour still wasn’t decent to go home.
